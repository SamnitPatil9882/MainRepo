To combine two commits into one, we can use an interactive rebase to 
squash the commits together.

c1 -- c2 -- c3 -- c4 

we want to combine 'c2' and 'c3' into single commit.

Steps:

1.	git rebase -i c1^
2.	text editor will open with list of commits.
3.	change the word pick to squash for commits you want to combine
4.	save and close the editor.
