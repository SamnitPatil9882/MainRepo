whent we try to push branch which have some content on remote which we have not pulled error msg will be displayed

example:
git push origin samnit
To github.com:SamnitPatil9882/MainRepo.git
 ! [rejected]        samnit -> samnit (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'github.com:SamnitPatil9882/MainRepo.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.




1. --force

	The '--force' option forcefully pushes our local changes to the reomote
  repository, discarding any changes on the remote that you don't have locally
  It doesn't consider the state of the remote repository, which can lead to
  unintended consequences if other contributors have made changes to the remote
  branch in the meantime

  command:
	git push --force origin samnit
